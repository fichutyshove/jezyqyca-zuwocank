Vanâ€™s chase to rescue the kidnapped Yuna leads him to the Ahfal Oma, the People of the Fire Horse. They reveal that the sickness plaguing Aquafa is no random resurgence but a carefully orchestrated revenge plan, and they want the leader of the Lone Antlers to join. Van canâ€™t abide a mad quest that threatens all of Aquafa, but heâ€™s still only one man. And how can a single man stop a diseaseâ€”especially one that already lives within him?
