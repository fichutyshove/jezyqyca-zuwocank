In this riveting sequel to The Pomegranate Gate, Toba, Naftaly, and their allies must defend a city under siegeâ€”while the desperate deals theyâ€™ve made begin to unravel around them.
 
 After a near-disastrous confrontation with La Caceria, Toba and Asmel are trapped on the human side of the gate, pursued by the Courser and a possessed Inquisitor. In the Mazik world, Naftalyâ€™s visions are getting worse, predicting the prosperous gate city of Zayit in flames and overrun by La Caceria. Zayit is notorious for its trade in salt, a substance toxic to the near-immortal Maziks; if the Cacador can control the salt, he will be nearly unstoppable. But the stolen killstone, the key to the Cacadorâ€™s destruction, could eliminate the threatâ€”if only Barsilay could find and use it.
 
 Deadly allies and even more dangerous bargains might be the only path to resist La Caceriaâ€™s ruthless conquest of both the mortal world and the Maziksâ€™, but the cost is steep and the threat is near. A twisty, clever entry in The Mirror Realm Cycle, The Republic of Salt asks what personal morals weigh in the face of widespread danger and how best to care for one another.
