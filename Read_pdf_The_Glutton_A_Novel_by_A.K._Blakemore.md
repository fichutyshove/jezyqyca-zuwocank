 ‚ÄúObscenely beautiful...Every sentence is gorgeous...Powerful and provocative.‚Äù ‚ÄîThe New York Times Book Review
 
 ‚ÄúThis year, I found myself seeking one quality above all others from the books I read: escapism. And no book plunged me into another world quite so bracingly as The Glutton.‚Äù ‚ÄîVogue
 
 1798, France. Nuns move along the dark corridors of a Versailles hospital where the young Sister Perpetu√© has been tasked with sitting with the patient who must always be watched. The man, gaunt, with his sallow skin and distended belly, is dying: they say he ate a golden fork, and that it‚Äôs killing him from the inside. But that‚Äôs not all‚Äîhe is rumored to have done monstrous things in his attempts to sate an insatiable appetite...an appetite they say tortures him still.
 
 Born in an impoverished village to a widowed young mother, Tarare was once overflowing with quiet affection: for the Baby Jesus and the many Saints, for his mother, for the plants and little creatures in the woods and fields around their house. He spends his days alone, observing the delicate charms of the countryside. But his world is not a gentle one‚Äîand soon, life as he knew it is violently upended. Tarare is pitched down a chaotic path through revolutionary France, left to the mercy of strangers, and increasingly, bottomlessly, ravenous.
 
 This exhilarating, disquieting novel paints a richly imagined life for The Great Tarare, The Glutton of Lyon in 18th-century France: a world of desire, hunger and poverty; hope, chaos and survival. As in her cult hit The Manningtree Witches, Blakemore showcases her stunning lyricism and deep compassion for characters pushed to the edge of society in The Glutton, her most unputdownable work yet.
